								<p>Welcome to my ESPM 50AC Final Project, an interactive exploration of the interactions between Alaska's Indigenous communities and the oil companies operating on their lands. As oil drilling continues to be a driving force of the economy in Alaska, its impact on the environment and culture of Indigidenous populations cannot be understated.</p>
								
								<p>Through various sections on the site, you can navigate the environmental damage and cultural disruptions that have arisen from oil exploration. Additionally, a detailed timeline will provide help contextualize past and ongoing impact of oil exploration in Alaska. Finally, testimonies from Indigenous individuals directly affected by oil drilling will offer a more personal perspective on these issues.</p>
								
								<p>My goal is to increase awareness of the strong correlation between natural resource exploitation and the negative impact it has on Indigenous communities, both in Alaska and in general. Through a multimedia format, I hope to engage the audience and provide a better understanding of the need for responsible and respectful resource management practices.</p>

								<h3>General Impacts</h3>
								<p> Oil exploration in Alaska has profound and far-reaching effects on the local ecosystems, which are among the most pristine and sensitive in the world. The operations involved in oil extraction include the construction of roads, pipelines, and drilling sites. They not only disrupt the natural landscape but also lead to significant habitat destruction and fragmentation. This destruction has serious implications for wildlife, particularly for species that depend on large, undisturbed areas for migration and breeding [1].</p>
									
								<p>The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), a vital habitat for polar bears, caribou, and migratory birds in Alaska, has been one of the most affected areas. Research shows that the noise and physical disturbances from drilling activities can alter the behaviors and migration patterns of these animals, which may lead to reductions in population sizes [2]. Additionally, the risk of oil spills is a constant threat; such spills can have devastating and long-lasting effects on water quality and aquatic life. The famous 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, although not a direct result of drilling, is an example of the catastrophic long-term environmental damages that spills can inflict on ecosystems [3].</p>
									
								<h3>Impact on Indigenous Populations</h3>
								<p>The environmental damages resulting from oil exploration in Alaska have had significant and direct impacts on the Indigenous populations who inhabit these regions. Among these communities, the Gwich’in and the Iñupiat especially stand out due to their strong connection to the land and their reliance on natural resources for food, cultural practices, and economic survival.</p>
								
								<h4>The Gwich’in Nation</h4>

    								<img src='images/gw.jpg' alt='missing' />
    								<figcaption>A picture of the Gwich'in people. [Image 3]</figcaption>
								</span>
								<p>The Gwich’in people, often referred to as the "Caribou People," are deeply connected to the Porcupine caribou herd, which migrates across the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). The Gwich’in's sustenance and cultural practices revolve around the caribou, which they rely on for food, clothing, and tools. Oil drilling in the ANWR threatens the caribou’s migration patterns and breeding grounds due to noise and human activity. Changes in the caribou population or migration routes can drastically affect the Gwich’in way of life, leading to food insecurity and loss of cultural practices [4].</p>
								
								<h4>The Iñupiat Community</h4>

    								<img src='images/inu.jpg' alt='missing' />
    								<figcaption>A picture of the Iñupiat people. [Image 4]</figcaption>
								</span>
								<p>The Iñupiat people reside primarily along the North Slope of Alaska and have a culture that is closely tied to whaling and the Arctic marine environment. Oil exploration and the associated risk of spills pose a significant threat to marine life, including bowhead whales, which are central to Iñupiat cultural identity. For the Iñupiat, a disaster like the Deepwater Horizon Spill could irreversibly harm their whaling culture and disrupt their food supply chain [5].</p>

								
								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p>The environmental costs of oil exploration in Alaska are considerable. The challenge  lies in balancing the economic benefits derived from oil exploration with the need to preserve Alaska's unique ecosystems and the cultural heritage of its Indigenous populations. The ongoing debate and research into sustainable development strategies are crucial for ensuring that economic growth does not come at the expense of environmental degradation and cultural loss. Policymakers, businesses, and communities must work together to develop approaches that respect and protect the natural and cultural landscapes of Alaska. Ensuring that future generations can inherit a healthy environment requires a comprehensive approach to natural resource management.</p>
